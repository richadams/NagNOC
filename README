0. Requirements

- PHP
- Nagios (hosted on the same box as the webserver I'm afraid).
- A monitor dedicated for graphs, preferably hanging from the ceiling or wall.
- A web browser running on a computer attached to said monitor.

1. Installation

Put index.php on your webserver. That's it.
You may need to edit the location of the Nagios status file at the top of index.php, but no other
modifications should be needed.

2. Customization

If you want to change the colours, they're clearly labelled in the CSS (index.php:360~)

You can change the refresh interval through a GET parameter "?refresh=100", etc.
